These uuencoded binary encoding files were copied from version 2.36-1
of the libxml-parser-perl package. They were originally created from
XML source files in the libxml-encoding-perl package (version 2.01-1)
with the 'compile_encoding' script in the same package:

 compile_encoding -o Parser/Encodings/$(encoding).enc /usr/share/libxml-encoding-perl/$(encoding).xml
