This package includes encodings built from the libxml-encoding-perl package.
However that package depends on this, so the most elegant packaging
causes a circular build dependency preventing binNMU. See #458144.
So we instead have a rule,  make_enodings, to build these encodings from
libxml-encoding-perl.
